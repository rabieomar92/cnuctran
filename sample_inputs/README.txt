README: Running CNUCTRAN for Test 1 - Test 4.

Thanks for willing to give this code a try.

To run Test 1 problem, 

Step 1: Double click the command prompt shortcut (cmd.lnk) to run cmd.exe
in the current directory.

Step 2: Copy any one of the xml input files in the sample_inputs directory
and paste it in the parent directory of sample_inputs (the directory containing cnuctran.exe)

Step 3: In the command prompt, type the following:

	cnuctran "filename.xml"
	
You may have to replace filename with the input file name, e.g. test_1.xml, test_2.xml, etc.






Done!
