				SPECIES DEFINITIONS.
			
				Each zone must have a list of species names to enable the calculation.

				DATA SOURCE.
				The user can provide the nuclides data via the following attribute:
				<species source=".\nuclides\data\source\location"></species>

				SPECIES NAME SPECIFICATION.
				The user may specify the names manually, OR, specify the range of species names:
				
				For example, if the user wishes to include all nuclides with atomic number within
				[100,300], then add the following attribute,
				
    				<species source="nuclides\data\source\" amin="100" amax="300">...</species>

				However, the nuclides data source file must be specified. Specifying amin and amax 
				attributes will ignore the species names listed in the species node.

				INITIAL CONCENTRATIONS SPECIFICATION.
				
				The user may define the initial concentration of each individual nuclide manually via
				the <n0 species="species_name" value="#####" /> tag.
 				The user can also import the previously calculated concentrations stored in an XML file.
				Note that the output XML of the previous calculations can serve as the initial concentration
				source file. To import the existing concentration file, the following attribute must exist,

				<initial_concentrations source=".\path\to\initial\concentration\file.xml"></initial_concentrations>

			 SIMULATION PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION.
			 
			 n is the order of the calculation. This simply means that the substep size is below 10^-n sec.
			 time_step is the time step of the calculation.
			 precision_digits is the minimum number of accurate digits maintained in the arithmetics.
			 output_digits is the number of decimal points to be displayed in the output.
			 verbosity is the verbosity level. A higher verbosity means more console output messages will be displayed.
			 output is the location of the output file on the disk.
			 max_rate is the maximum removal rate to be considered in the calculation.*
			 min_rate is the minimum removal rate to be considered in the calculation.**
			 
			 *Any removal rates that fall above max_rate will be ignored by the program.
			 **Any removal rates that fall below min_rate will be ignored by the program.
