			 SIMULATION PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION.
			 
			 n is the order of the calculation. This simply means that the substep size is below 10^-n sec.
			 time_step is the time step of the calculation.
			 precision_digits is the minimum number of accurate digits maintained in the arithmetics.
			 output_digits is the number of decimal points to be displayed in the output.
			 verbosity is the verbosity level. A higher verbosity means more console output messages will be displayed.
			 output is the location of the output file on the disk.
			 max_rate is the maximum removal rate to be considered in the calculation.*
			 min_rate is the minimum removal rate to be considered in the calculation.**
			 
			 *Any removal rates that fall above max_rate will be ignored by the program.
			 **Any removal rates that fall below min_rate will be ignored by the program.
